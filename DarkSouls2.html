                which changed the gameplay in unexpected ways. They also introduced a new mechanic, dual weilding, which allows player to use 2 weapons at the same time providing they had the correct stats.</td>

                was the addition of fast travel, when you first rest at a bonfire, you can they travel to it from any other bonfire you have previously been to. This was a massive improvement compared to 
                the first game in which you had to run everywhere.</td>
