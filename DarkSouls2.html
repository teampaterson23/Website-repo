                            The gameplay in Dark Souls 2 was pretty different when compared to the first game, there was
                            a new attribute to level up called adaptability, which changed the gameplay in unexpected
                            ways. They also introduced a new mechanic, dual weilding, which allows player to use 2
                            weapons at the same time providing they had the correct stats.

                            The world of Dark Souls 2 is interesting, makes the player want to explore and find out what
                            the world has to offer. Another mechanic they added in this game was the addition of fast
                            travel, when you first rest at a bonfire, you can they travel to it from any other bonfire
                            you have previously been to. This was a massive improvement compared to the first game in
                            which you had to run everywhere.

                            Dark Souls 2 is considered by many to be the most difficult in the souls series, this is due
                            to the fact that the developers tried making the game harder by added more enemies in one
                            area, meaning the player would get surrounded and be overwhelmed easily. They also added a
                            new stat called 'Adaptability'. This made it so that when the player rolled or dodged an attack,
                            they would get less 'eye-frames', which are frames of invulnerability, making it harder and less
                            consistent to dodge attacks.
