        <p>There are other games that FromSoft have made other than the Dark Soul's series, these games inlude, Bloodborne which was released in March of 2015, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon Soul's and Elden
        Ring. Each of these games have their own uniqueness, with Dark Soul's being inspired by Demon Soul's, this caused the creation of the Dark Soul's series that we all know today.</p>

        <h1>Bloodborne</h1>

        <p>Bloodborne was released for the PS4 in March of 2015 and is similar to Dark Soul's but also has some unique mechanics, one big difference being that Bloodborne is a much more
        aggressive game than the others, encouraging players to keep attacking after taking damage because they can regain that lost health. There is also transformable weapons, which allows the player
        to change a weapon mid fight, changing the flow of the attack and how to weapon deals damage. The atmosphere of Bloodborne is very dark and gothic,
        with the player exploring the city of 'Yharnam' while trying to survive. </p>
