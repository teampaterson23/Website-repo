                    Bloodborne was released for the PS4 in March of 2015 and is similar to Dark Soul's but also has some
                    unique mechanics, one big difference being that Bloodborne is a much more aggressive game than the
                    others, encouraging players to keep attacking after taking damage because they can regain that lost
                    health. There is also transformable weapons, which allows the player to change a weapon mid fight,
                    changing the flow of the attack and how to weapon deals damage. The atmosphere of Bloodborne is very
                    dark and gothic, with the player exploring the city of 'Yharnam' while trying to survive.

                    Sekiro was released on the 22nd March 2019 and is completely different to the Dark Soul's games. The
                    gameplay focuses on sword attacks, parrying and maintaining a new mechanic called the posture bar.
                    The world of Sekiro is a fantasy version of the Sengoku era in Japan. It features many different
                    locations such as Ashina, The Sunken River and many more the player can explore. The bosses in this
                    game are similar in the way that they fight you, but they require the player to learn attacks and
                    parry at the correct time. There are many different upgrades for the player such as special
                    moves/attacks, gaining more health and more.

                    Demon Souls was the released before Dark Souls and was the game to inspire the creation of it. The
                    orignal Demon Souls was released in 2009 for the PS3 and the remake in November 2020. Demon Souls
                    was a bit different to Dark Souls, this game had a mechanic called Character and World Tendency, the
                    way this worked was anytime the player killed a boss or did a certain action, the Character or World
                    Tendency can change. This can affect the enimes of the game. If a player completes good actions the
                    Tendency will lean towards white, this mean enemies will be weaker but also drop less souls, while
                    the player can do the opposite and complete bad actions, the Tendency will become black, this makes
                    it so that enemies are stronger but also drop more items.
