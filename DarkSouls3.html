                Dark Souls 3 is the final game in the Dark Souls trilogy and was realeased in March of 2016. There were
                a few new additions to this game compared to the others, such as the introduction of new magic items.
                This added different types of spells such as miracles, pyromancies and sorceries. With these different
                types of magic, it added much more choice for the player and added more interesting gameplay.

                            Dark Souls 3's gameplay was considered the best in the seires, the combat was smooth and
                            fully fleshed out, all weapons felt useful and that you had the freedom to use whatever you
                            like. The big thing about the gameplay was the bosses and Dark Souls 3 had some of the best
                            in the seires such as The Nameless King, Pontiff Sulyvahn and The Abyss Watchers.

                            Dark Souls 3 isn't too difficult but is also not too easy. The game gives the player lots of
                            options to aid them on their journey but still leaves you feeling like you could have
                            something better. The game expands of many different things such as magic and the amount of
                            weapon options that the player has.
