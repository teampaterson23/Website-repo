                Dark Souls is an action RPG in which the player gets to create a character and choose from a few
                different classes. While playing, you explore the world, collect different items and fights enemies. As
                you explore you will encounter different bosses that have a unique attack pattern compaired to a regular
                enemy. The more bosses and enemies you kill, the more souls you will gain, these are used for buying
                items and levelling up your character.

                            The graphics in Dark Souls are decent, for the time in 2011 they would have been pretty
                            good,<br />but because the game got a remaster, the graphics got slightly upgraded.

                            The story of Dark Souls is very in depth and detailed, the only problem is people have to
                            look for clues and hidden details in character dialogue and item descriptions. For the die
                            hard fans, this is exactly the kind of storytelling they like, but for newcomers to the
                            game, it can be difficult and confusing to understand which might push them away from trying
                            to find out what happens. In the story of the game, you need to ge the lordvessel and fight
                            the Great Lord Gwyn to undo the curse of the Undead.
